#Create a variable called 'number' and assign it the two-digit number
number = 98
a = number % 10 
a = str(a)
number //= 10 
number = str(number)
#Find the reverse of the number and assign it to a variable called 'answer'.
answer = a + number
#Print the answer variable
print(answer)

#I solved on this task depending on the topic you taught us
#So, I converted value int to string
